/**
 * Every packaging target electron-builder.yml declares must reach the published
 * release, and this file is the only thing that can say so on a commit.
 *
 * **It exists because the answer was no in three sibling repositories, and
 * nothing noticed for months.** Taliesin declared both `nsis` and `portable`
 * while its workflow packaged `--win portable`, so eight releases shipped no
 * installer (HTOO-369); balor published four assets where five were configured;
 * dagda shipped v1.0.0 through v1.3.0 with the same hole. Every gate in every
 * one of them passed the whole time: the config was right, the workflow was
 * valid YAML, and `fail_on_unmatched_files: true` says nothing at all about a
 * file **nobody asked for**. **A requirement expressed only as a list of globs
 * cannot report the entry that is missing from the list.**
 *
 * Corvath was the inverse case and had it easier: the workflow already packaged
 * a bare `--win`, and the config declared only `portable`, so nothing was
 * silently dropped -- there simply was no installer. This guard lands with the
 * nsis target so the honest state cannot drift back.
 *
 * Read as raw text rather than parsed: there is no YAML dependency in this
 * repository, these are files it owns, and the job is to catch a human edit
 * rather than to be a general parser.
