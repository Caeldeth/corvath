// Read the Electron fuse wire back out of a PACKAGED binary and fail if the
// fuses `electron-builder.yml` configures are not what it asked for.
//
// HTOO-403. Why this exists rather than trusting the YAML: the fuse wire is
// written into the binary during packaging, so the config is proof that
// electron-builder was ASKED, not that it did it. `npm run validate`, the whole
// unit suite and every e2e spec pass on a build that has silently stopped
// applying them, because none of them ever look at an artifact — Playwright
// drives `out/`. The failure is silent by construction, which is the argument
// for automating the check rather than against it.
//
// Corvath is more exposed to this than it looks. It ships TWO Windows artifacts
// and both wrap the same `win-unpacked/corvath.exe` — the portable exe as a
// self-extracting stub, the installer by writing it to disk — so one check
// covers both, which is worth doing deliberately rather than checking whichever
// artifact someone happens to think of.
//
// Ported from taliesin's implementation (HTOO-167), itself from balor's
// (HTOO-303). Copied rather than re-derived because of the first trap below.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO:
//
//  * It does not use `getCurrentFuseWire` from `@electron/fuses`, and that is a
//    real defect rather than a preference. That function reads the FIRST
//    sentinel only. A mac universal binary has two — `flipFuses` writes both —
//    and corvath's dmg is built for `arch: universal`, so the public reader
//    would check the x64 slice, report a pass, and never read arm64. A verifier
//    that cannot see half the artifact it is verifying is worse than none,
//    because it reads as coverage. This scans EVERY sentinel and asserts each.
//
//  * It does not launch anything. The behavioural half — that
//    `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 corvath.exe -e "…"` cannot execute a marker — means
//    launching a GUI app on a displayless runner and deciding it "has not
//    printed anything yet", which is a timing assumption about someone else's
//    binary that nobody here has measured. Run that by hand.
//
