// Privacy scrubbing for captured errors and the diagnostics block. PURE — no
// node/electron imports; the caller (main) passes `homeDir` / `userName` in from
// `os.*`, which is what keeps this unit-testable and keeps `shared/` free of node.
//
// **Scrubbing runs at CAPTURE**, in `main/sessionLog.ts`, before the ring buffer
// and before disk. One scrub site covers every source — main's own uncaught
// errors, forwarded renderer errors, and React's `componentDidCatch` — which is
// what makes the on-disk session logs already safe to hand to a bug report. There
// is no second sanitising pass on attach; `main/diagnostics.ts` runs one more over
// the assembled block only as idempotent insurance.
//
// Goal: strip anything identifying a person or a machine — usernames, home and
// data paths, emails and IP addresses — while leaving enough of an error (type,
// message, file basename) to debug from.
//
// **Corvath's exposure differs from balor's, and the difference is worth naming.**
// Balor added the credential rules because it captures git's own stderr, and git
// echoes the remote URL — sometimes carrying a token — in most of its failure
// messages. Corvath spawns nothing, holds no credential, and talks to one
// unauthenticated endpoint (the GitHub releases API in `updateCheck.ts`). The
// three generic container rules are kept anyway as cheap insurance: they match the
// SHAPE a secret travels in rather than guessing at its value, so they cannot go
// stale the way a prefix match would.
//
// What corvath's logs actually carry is **paths** — the data directory, a deck's
// image folder, an imported file the user picked. So the path rules are the ones
// doing the work here, and they are the reason this runs at all.

 *   which still names the failing endpoint. Letting the email rule reach it first
 *   would produce `https://<email>/…` — redacted, but no longer an answer to
 *   "which endpoint".
 * - **Deep paths before account paths**, so an embedded username is dropped with
 *   the whole path rather than redacted in place inside a path that survives.
 * - **`homeDir` after both**, because it exists for the install that lives nowhere
 *   near `/home` or `C:\Users` and is therefore the case the shapes above miss.
