/**
 * Settings, as a page reached from the nav tabs.
 *
 * The house shape (balor / taliesin / oghma) is a scrollable responsive grid of
 * `<Paper>` cards, one per concern — not a tab strip. A later WP adds cards to
 * this grid rather than rebuilding the shell.
 *
 * Appearance, Draw defaults and About. The three draw defaults were the
 * candidates HTOO-408 left open and Sabrael took on 2026-08-15; each is a choice
 * a user would otherwise re-pick on every draw, which is the bar a setting has to
 * clear here. A setting that only ever takes its default is worse than no
 * setting — a control to render, a schema field to validate, a migration to
 * carry and a line of documentation, for nothing.
