/**
 * The top-level React error boundary: what replaces the white screen.
 *
 * **Mounted outside `<App>`'s `ThemeProvider`, in `main.tsx`, and that is the whole
 * point of where it sits.** A render error inside the themed tree unmounts that
 * tree, so a fallback rendered under the same provider is a fallback rendered by the
 * thing that just failed. Everything below therefore renders on MUI's default theme
 * — plainer than the rest of Corvath, and reliably present.
 *
 * **The fallback carries its OWN `ReportIssueDialog` with its own local flag**, not
 * the one `App` mounts and not `reportStore`'s. By the time this renders, `App` is
 * gone; the dialog works anyway because it takes everything it shows over IPC and
 * holds no application state at all.
 *
 * `componentDidCatch` forwards to main, so a React error lands in the same session
 * log as an uncaught exception and a rejected promise. It is the third source into
 * the one scrub site, which is what makes the log safe to attach without a second
 * pass over it.
 *
 * A class component, because `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch`
 * have no hook equivalent. React still offers none; this is not an oversight.
