// Renderer-boundary hardening. Adapted from dagda's `windowSecurity.ts` (itself
// from mabon's WP18 pass, which answered a real static audit). Three apps found
// the same scaffold-inherited holes; corvath grew from the same skeleton, so it
// had them too.
//
// Three protections, kept in ONE place so the policy is single-sourced and
// auditable rather than scattered across window constructors:
//
//   1. hardenWindow() — deny top-level navigation away from our own content, and
//      deny every child window. The main window still hands *validated* external
//      URLs to the OS; the splash opens nothing.
//   2. guardIpc()     — wrap ipcMain so every handler rejects an IPC whose sender
//      is not the top frame of a known corvath window at our own location.
//   3. Trusted-window registration, so an unexpected webContents cannot reach the
//      handler registry just by existing.
//
// Two things dagda has that corvath does not, and why they are absent rather than
// forgotten: there is no `hardenWebviews` (corvath never sets `webviewTag`, so no
// <webview> can attach), and there are no window ROLES (corvath's only other
// window is the splash, which loads with no preload and therefore has no bridge
// to send IPC over at all).
//
// This is a SECOND gate, independent of payload validation. The zod schemas in
// `schemas/` still parse every mutating payload; nothing here replaces that.
