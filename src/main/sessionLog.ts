/**
 * Per-session ERROR log. One file per launch under `<userData>/logs`, keeping the
 * five most recent.
 *
 * **Errors only, never a trace.** Corvath spawns git constantly and polls on a
 * cadence; a debug log of that is a large file nobody reads, and it would put every
 * repository path the user watches on disk in exchange for nothing. What is here
 * is what a bug report needs: the things that went wrong this session.
 *
 * **Scrubbed at CAPTURE — before the ring buffer, before the file.** That is the
 * invariant the whole module rests on, because it is what makes an on-disk log
 * already safe to attach to a public issue. There is no sanitising pass on the way
 * out; if this one is skipped, nothing downstream repairs it. WP10's constraint
 * lands exactly here: `github/tokenStore.ts` and `github/client.ts` each assert no
 * log line holds the token, and this module inherits that requirement without
 * inheriting either test — `session-log.test.ts` writes them again.
 *
 * **Best-effort throughout.** A logging failure must never disturb the app: every
 * filesystem call swallows its error, and there is no path by which `captureError`
 * can throw. It is called FROM the global error handlers, so a throw here would be
 * a second uncaught error raised while reporting the first.
 *
 * Appends are serialised through a queue — `settingsManager`'s pattern — so two
 * errors a millisecond apart cannot interleave half-lines. A log whose lines are
 * spliced together is worse than one that lost a line, because it reads as a real
 * stack that never happened.
 *
 * `logs/` is a subfolder rather than a file beside `settings.json`, so
 * **Reveal logs folder** has a target that holds nothing else.
