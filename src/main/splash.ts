 * Frameless, transparent splash window shown the instant the app boots — before
 * the main window's renderer bundle has evaluated. It stays up until the
 * renderer signals `app:ready` (see the boot sequence in `index.ts`), so the
 * user gets immediate branded feedback instead of a few seconds of nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free and self-contained (loads a static
 * `resources/splash.html`, which pulls in the app logo from the same folder)
 * — ported from taliesin.
